# Browser Based Serial Dashboard
Did you know most modern browsers support Serial Communication? Don't worry, neither did I untill I was working on a project and "out grew" the Arduino serial monitor .  Here is a simple(ish) browser based serial monitoring, command, and dashboard tool I built [serialdashboard.com](https://www.serialdashboard.com).

## Features
- Monitor incoming messages over serial: e.g. from an arduino or esp32 board.
- Send messages over serial: e.g. send command messages
- Monitor Metrics: track and plot metrics over time
- Build Customizable Dashboards:
    -  TODO: Add Examples with Screen Shots

## TODO: 
- ~~Write~~ Improve README
- Add Help Section to website

## INSTALLATION
    >> git clone https://github.com/smartfastlabs/serial-dashboard.git
    >> cd serial-dashboard
    >> npm install
    >> npm run dev
