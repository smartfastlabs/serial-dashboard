Did you know most modern browsers support Serial Communication? Don't worry, neither did I untill I was working on a project and "out grew" the Arduino serial monitor .  Here is a simple(ish) browser based serial monitoring, command, and dashboard tool I built [serialdashboard.com](https://www.serialdashboard.com).

## Features
- Monitor incoming messages over serial: e.g. from an arduino or esp32 board.
- Send messages over serial: e.g. send command messages
- Monitor Metrics: track and plot metrics over time
- Build Customizable Dashboards:
    -  TODO: Add Examples with Screen Shots

## TODO: 
- ~~Write~~ Improve README
- Add Help Section to website
